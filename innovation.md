# Think Innovation: Focus on differentiating over common use cases

Innovation should not be used as a buzzword that it becomes hard to remember what it actually means. Innovation should not be used as a bar to compare one company against another, i.e. "let's create the next Apple" or "let's not be the next Yahoo!". Companies can innovate in several different ways. 
Instead of generic innovation goals, the goal should be to narrow the focus on a specific type of inovation in order to become a more effective and stratigic innovator. 

Three areas of focus for innovation: Product, Process, & Business.

## Product

Product innovation can come in the form of:

1. The development of a new product or feature.
2. Improving the performance of an existing product.
3. Adding a new feature to an already existing product.

Product innovation is generally customer facing and should result in greater demand.

## Process

Althogh broad, product innovation can be used to produce, deliver, and support a product or provide a service, and can include changes in technology i.e. the software used in product design and development. Process innovation is a combination of facilities, skills, and technologies.

## Business
