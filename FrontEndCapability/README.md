# Enterprise Architecture Principles (Front End Capability).

The perpose of this section is to answer our architecutal 

____

## Think Integrity: Guard the accuracy of your data 
Data integrity is broken down into two modes of thought; *process* and *state*. As far as process is concerned the front end should put as many steps in place to ensure that the date that is processed to get as close to a standard 

## Think consumer-grade: Use design thinking 
Consistant frameworks for design over implentation solutions.


## Think ecosystems: Build for long term efficiency and maximum value


## Think Security: Design for real world threats and to maintain compliance


## Think cloud: Build for scale and agility


## Think real-time: Integrate immediate analysis with transactions, events and context
What where and when of actionable business events that occur should handle in a clearly defined front-end transaction. Keep event hooks in mind as architecting these solutions, for potential broadcasting and logging.



## Think digital business: Use event-driven architecture in the event-driven world

Â 
## Think business objectives: Choose macroservices, miniservices or microservices
This particular architectural guideline has a tangential effect on the frontend. When creating front-end applications favor domain driven microservices first, then explore aggregation APIs second. Only when the performance of microservices begins to degrade the client application, should you try to create apis to format data specific to client-side representation.


## Think business outcomes: Organize around capabilities not technologies


## Think reusability: Develop solutions that maximize reuse and control technical diversity


## Think insight: Design for analytics and intelligence everywhere


## Think Innovation: Focus on differentiating over common use cases
